Zip Repository for addons downloads

1/ Click on the file you wish to download.

2/ In the new window Right Click the "Raw" buttons & Save File As

3/ Use the Install Addon from file button in Blender & run the addons.

4/ To use AF_add_objects_specials it's a requirement of the addon to use my patched version of space_view3d.py.
This is availible here: https://github.com/meta-androcto/blenderpython/blob/master/scripts/startup/bl_ui/space_view3d.py
& provides compact 3d view menu's in Object mode. Well worth the effort.
